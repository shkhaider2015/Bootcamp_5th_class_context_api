# Bootcamp Class 5th - React Context API

I took the following steps, all bootcampers should also do this on there own repos

Signup on GitHub.com and Install GitHub Desktop on your computer
https://desktop.github.com/ (For Mac and Windows users) https://github.com/shiftkey/desktop#debianubuntu-distributions (For Linux users)

Using Github Desktop create new public repo and publish it on GitHub.com

Install VS Code, we will use it as our code editor

https://code.visualstudio.com/download

Create a simple hello world html file and name it index.html. Using GitHub desktop commit the code and push it.

Install Node.js

https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Install Surge
npm install --global surge

Generate Surge token by the following command
surge token

Save the surge token in the repo's GitHubs secrets

Learn and create surge deployment action file in root of your repo in .github/workflow directory like I have done

Make small change in your index.html, commit it and push it again to github.com

Check the action tab to GitHub website and see if the action executed

open website in browser

NOTE: Assumption is that you know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
